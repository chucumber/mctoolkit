      <b>Kristina Ketola Bore</b> joined Kunsthall Stavanger in 2019, coming from a background as a curator, writer, and editor. Since then, she has played a pivotal role in shaping the institution’s curatorial and strategic direction. Her work at the kunsthall includes exhibitions and commissioned projects with artists such as Lex Brown, Bárbara Wagner & Benjamin de Burca, Cindy Ji Hye Kim, Nnena Kalu, Laurel Schwulst, and Farah Al Qasimi, among others.
<br><br>
With a sustained interest in social practice, Kristina has significantly expanded the institution’s educational initiatives—growing the team, structuring a comprehensive program, and launching Mobilizing Citizenship, a practice-based research project for youth focused on civic engagement through art.
<br><br>
A key advocate for digital innovation, Kristina has been instrumental in developing Kunsthall Stavanger’s digital platform, commissioning and curating online works such as Mouthpiece (2022) by Stine Janvin, a participatory digital performance, and the series Queer Culture Year: Even When We Can't We Must (2023).
<br><br>
Beyond her curatorial work, Kristina is a central force in the ongoing development of Kunsthall Stavanger as a forward-looking institution. She also serves as deputy chair of Kunsthallene i Norge, contributing to the national discourse on contemporary art and institutional development.

      <b>Delali Ayivor</b> is a Ghanaian-American writer, archivist, and information systems designer. Her work is grounded in her lived experience growing up in the Global South, where access to mainstream flows of information were often fractured, tenuous, refracted, or distorted. She wrote once of Ghana: ‘this is as West Africa is, constantly trapped somewhere in the binary of finite and fracture.’ Thus, her work—like her country and herself—is fundamentally concerned with the structural: intersections, frictions, overlaps, and sites of disjuncture.
<br><br>
She is a 2024 graduate of the Pratt Institute School of Information with an MS in Library and Information Sciences; a graduate of Interlochen Arts Academy and Reed College, a 2011 US Presidential Scholar in the Arts, a 2020 Tin House Workshop Scholar, and a member of the second class of Kehinde Wiley’s Black Rock Senegal residency. She currently lives and works in Accra, Ghana.

      <b>Chire “VantaBlack” Regans</b>' art practice exists at the intersection of social justice and storytelling. Her work responds to urgent societal concerns and functions as a critical platform to amplify the voices of community members who are often silenced. Over the past decade, Chire has focused primarily on community advocacy and depicting social narratives without distortion in various mediums. For Chire, a Saint Louis native, the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement triggered a sense of urgency in her art practice. Her work continues to evolve, allowing for broader social accessibility and creative scale. In South Florida, Chire continues to marry her artistic practice with community-led activism, emphasising the art of storytelling as a means of engaging with communities with radical empathy and transparency.

      <b>Walk of Shame (WOS)</b> is an artist collective based in Bergen, Norway, working at the intersection of visual art, performance, and social space. Their practice explores participation, community, and the aesthetics of excess, often creating immersive environments that blur the boundaries between audience and performer. With a playful yet critical approach, WOS stages works that challenge conventions of taste, behaviour, and collectivity, inviting participants into transformative and unpredictable experiences.
