is a Ghanaian-American writer, archivist, and information systems designer. Her work is grounded in her lived experience growing up in the Global South, where access to mainstream flows of information were often fractured, tenuous, refracted, or distorted. She wrote once of Ghana: ‘this is as West Africa is, constantly trapped somewhere in the binary of finite and fracture.’ Thus, her work—like her country and herself—is fundamentally concerned with the structural: intersections, frictions, overlaps, and sites of disjuncture.
