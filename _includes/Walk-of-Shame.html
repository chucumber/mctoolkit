Walk of Shame (WOS) is an artist collective based in Bergen, Norway, working at the intersection of visual art, performance, and social space. Their practice explores participation, community, and the aesthetics of excess, often creating immersive environments that blur the boundaries between audience and performer. With a playful yet critical approach, WOS stages works that challenge conventions of taste, behaviour, and collectivity, inviting participants into transformative and unpredictable experiences.
